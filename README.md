Your Excellency President Mahmoud Abbas,
Your Excellency Ambassador Riyad Mansour,

We, the undersigned global citizens, write to you to express our profound solidarity with the Palestinian people and our unwavering support for your ongoing diplomatic efforts to secure their protection, dignity, and right to self-determination.

We commend your excellencies’ steadfast advocacy on the world stage, including Ambassador Mansour’s powerful appeal to the United Nations Security Council on July 25, 2025, where he called for a multinational UN force to protect Palestinians and accelerate “unfettered humanitarian assistance by the United Nations and international organizations.” This appeal emphasized that it is “time to end Israel’s colonization, annexation schemes and apartheid regime. It is time to end this illegal occupation.”

In light of the escalating humanitarian catastrophe and the ongoing threats to civilian life, we respectfully and urgently encourage your delegation to pursue all available mechanisms to translate these words into immediate actions. Specifically, we urge you to:

1- Send a letter to the UN Secretary General, President of the General Assembly, and President of the Security Council requesting the immediate re-opening of the Tenth Emergency Special Session under Uniting for Peace.

2- Use this session to present a decisive resolution calling for the immediate mandating and deployment of a United Nations multinational Protection Force for Gaza. The core mission of this force must be to (a) provide protection for Palestinian civilians, (b) ensure the safe and unhindered distribution of humanitarian aid by the United Nations and its partners, (c ) preserve evidence of Israeli crimes, and (d) facilitate recovery and reconstruction.

3- Further call on the General Assembly to use its powers under Uniting for Peace to:
-  Protect civilian efforts to assist in delivery of humanitarian aid, such as the Global Sumud Flotilla;
-  Call for (and monitor) comprehensive sanctions and a military embargo on the Israeli regime;
-  Reactivate the UN’s long-dormant anti-apartheid mechanisms to address Israeli apartheid;
-  Create a criminal tribunal to address the war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide perpetrated by the Israeli regime;
-  Reject Israel’s General Assembly credentials (as was done with apartheid South Africa)

4- Hold firm in the upcoming negotiations and urge all Member States to support these concrete measures to compel Israel’s full compliance with the binding orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the demands of the General Assembly.

The world is watching, and history will judge our collective action, or inaction, at this pivotal moment. We believe that the immediate mobilization of a protective international presence is a vital and necessary step toward alleviating the immense suffering of the Palestinian people, ending the mass slaughter of civilians, and creating the conditions for justice.

Requesting urgent action to enable the GA to deploy Gaza protection force
```

**Body**

Your Excellency,

I urgently appeal to the United Nations General Assembly to invoke its authority under the landmark Uniting for Peace resolution (Resolution 377(V)) to authorize the immediate deployment of a Multinational Protection Force for Gaza.
This decisive mechanism, first used to compel the withdrawal of French, British, and Israeli forces from Suez in 1956, was established precisely to bypass the Security Council deadlock and allow the General Assembly to take action in the face of a threat to peace. The current crisis demands such historic and decisive action to protect civilians and uphold international law.
In light of the escalating humanitarian catastrophe and the ongoing threats to civilian life, I respectfully and urgently encourage you to: 

1- Use the Tenth Emergency Special Session under Uniting for Peace to enact a decisive resolution calling for the immediate mandating and deployment of a United Nations multinational Protection Force for Gaza. The core mission of this force must be to (a) provide protection for Palestinian civilians, (b) ensure the safe and unhindered distribution of humanitarian aid by the United Nations and its partners, (c ) preserve evidence of Israeli crimes, and (d) facilitate recovery and reconstruction.

2- We further call on the General Assembly to use its powers under Uniting for Peace to: 
-  Protect civilian efforts to assist in delivery of humanitarian aid, such as the Global Sumud Flotilla; 
-  Call for (and monitor) comprehensive sanctions and a military embargo on the Israeli regime;
-  Reactivate the UN’s long-dormant anti-apartheid mechanisms to address Israeli apartheid; 
-  Create a criminal tribunal to address the war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide perpetrated by the Israeli regime;
-  Reject Israel’s General Assembly credentials (as was done with apartheid South Africa)
3- Hold firm in the upcoming negotiations and urge all Member States to support these concrete measures to compel Israel’s full compliance with the binding orders of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the demands of the General Assembly. 
I note that the French-Saudi proposal does not meet the test of Palestinian protection, rights, and sovereignty, and should be rejected and replaced with this proposal.
Thank you for your attention to, and timely action upon, this urgent matter.  I urge you to act swiftly and in accordance with the principles of humanity and international law, and look forward to your positive response.
